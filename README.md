# Collector
Created during Cal Hacks 5.0.

The Collector is a map app that allows users to easily geocache. Basically, users can leave interesting items in random places and place a pin on it to signify its locations, along with name, description, and images. Other users can go out and find these items and take it for themselves.

Take a picture and send to original poster to verify and remove the pin from the map.

Note: Some features are work in progress.
